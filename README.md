# Data Science and Machine Learning Workspace

This workspace is designed for learning various aspects of data science and machine learning using Python-based libraries.

## Environment Setup

This project uses a conda environment called `ml-env` with Python 3.12. To activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate ml-env
```

## Learning Path

1. Start with basic statistics and EDA in the `01_statistics` folder
2. Move to data preprocessing techniques in `02_data_preprocessing`
3. Explore supervised learning in `03_supervised_learning` 
4. Learn unsupervised techniques in `04_unsupervised_learning`
5. Dive into deep learning with `05_deep_learning`
6. Apply skills in mini-projects in `06_projects`

Happy Learning!
